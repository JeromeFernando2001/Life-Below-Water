                    <p>The splash screen is an introduction feature of our project, which is a visually appealing and informative initial impression. 
                       It has an underwater backdrop that is aligned with the subject matter of marine conservation, together with the United Nations 
                       and Sustainable Development Goals logos, thereby showcasing the global significance of the issue. The brief message outlines 
                       the objective of the project, mentioning the importance of conserving marine ecosystems and advocating for sustainable 
                       conservation behaviors.<br>
                       This page is utilized to capture the users' attention right away, so they know the purpose of the website before moving ahead. 
                       By providing a simple message and a minimal design, the splash screen allows a smooth transition to the core content without 
                       diverting the users' interest.
