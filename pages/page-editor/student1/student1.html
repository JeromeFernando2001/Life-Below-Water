                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>I have created this splash screen using HTML and CSS to make it visually appealing and fully responsive. 
                            I used a "&lt;div class="splash-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; to cover the entire screen and added a background image with 
                            background-size: cover; so it scales properly. To make the text readable over the image, I added an overlay using
                            .splash-container::before, which gives a semi-transparent blue effect. Inside this container, 
                            I placed another "&lt;div class="content"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; to hold the logos, heading, description, and team names.
                            The logos are styled with brightness and a glow effect using filter: brightness(2) contrast(1.2); 
                            and box-shadow, making them stand out.<br>
                            For the text, I used &lt;h1&gt; for the title and &lt;h2&gt; for the team section, ensuring a clear structure. 
                            I also added text-shadow to improve readability against the background.
                            The description and team names are styled with color: white; and opacity: 0.9; to create a clean 
                            and soft look. To make the page more interactive, I added a fade in animation using @keyframes fadeIn, 
                            making the content appear smoothly.<br>
                            Since the page needs to work well on different screen sizes, I used media queries. 
                            On tablets and smaller screens, I reduced font sizes, adjusted padding, and made the logos smaller to keep everything balanced. 
                            Overall, I focused on design, functionality, and responsiveness to ensure the page looks good and is easy to read on any device.
                        </p> 
                    
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>I made sure to address accessibility in this splash screen by following key principles that improve readability, usability,
                           and inclusivity. First, I used semantic HTML elements such as &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;h2&gt; for headings and &lt;p&gt; for descriptions. 
                           This helps screen readers and improves the pageâ€™s structure for users who rely on assistive technologies.<br>
                           To ensure text readability, I used high color contrast by setting color: white; for the text and applying a semi transparent overlay
                           (.splash-container::before) to darken the background. This prevents text from blending into the image, making it easier to read. 
                           I also added text shadow to further enhance visibility.<br>
                           For responsive design, I used media queries to adjust text size, layout, and padding for different screen sizes. 
                           This helps users who access the page from mobile devices or tablets. 
                           Additionally, images such as the logos include an alt attribute, so screen readers can describe them to visually impaired users.<br>
                           The fade-in animation is subtle and does not flash or move too fast, reducing the risk of motion triggered discomfort for users with visual sensitivity. 
                           By following these accessibility practices, I made sure the page is inclusive, easy to navigate, and visually clear for all users.
                        </p>

                <h2 id="volunteer">Volunteer Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>This webpage was implemented using HTML and CSS to create a structured and visually appealing
                             volunteer opportunities page. The HTML structure includes a header section with a dropdown for sorting, 
                             a scrollable card section showcasing volunteer opportunities, a review section, and a feedback form. 
                             The card layout is designed using div containers, with image elements, text headings (h3, h4), 
                             and buttons (a.btn) for interaction. The CSS enhances the design by using flexbox for layout organization,
                              scroll-snap-type for a smooth horizontal scrolling experience, and box-shadow to create depth in the card 
                              designs. The use of a consistent color palette and border-radius improves aesthetics, 
                              while hover effects (:hover) on buttons and icons enhance user engagement.
                        </p> 

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>Accessibility is addressed by ensuring proper text contrast, scalable fonts (rem, em), and semantic HTML elements
                             (h2, p, button, select) for better screen reader support. The alt attributes in images ensure visually impaired 
                             users can understand the content. The scrollable container is designed with scroll-snap-type, providing a 
                             smooth navigation experience for keyboard users. The feedback section uses interactive elements (button, textarea) 
                             that are easy to navigate, and the star rating system provides a visual representation of user reviews. 
                             The site is also responsive (@media queries),ensuring it is accessible across different screen sizes and devices.
                        </p>

            <section>
                <h2 id="content">Content Page-Ocean Pollution</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>In developing this webpage, I used several fundamental HTML tags to ensure a well-structured and organized 
                            layout. The  &lt;html&gt; tag serves as the root element, while the  &lt;head&gt; section contains metadata, including links
                            to external stylesheets and Font Awesome icons. The  &lt;body&gt; holds the main content, where I used  &lt;section&gt;, 
                            &lt;div&gt;, and  &lt;p&gt; tags to divide the webpage into meaningful sections. 
                            The  &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt; and  &lt;h3&gt; tags help establish a clear hierarchy, making the content easy to navigate. 
                            Additionally, I included a navigation bar with  &lt;nav&gt; and  &lt;a&gt; elements to allow users to jump between 
                            different sections seamlessly. The  &lt;button&gt; tag is also used to encourage user interaction, such as taking 
                            action against ocean pollution.<br>
                            For styling, I applied various CSS properties to enhance the visual appeal and improve user experience. 
                            The background-image property in the .entry-container class adds a compelling ocean pollution image, 
                            reinforcing the theme. I used display: flex in multiple sections, such as .navbar and .solutions-container,
                            to align elements efficiently. The color, font-size, and font-weight properties ensure that text is readable,
                            while border-radius and transition enhance the interactive elements like buttons. 
                            To maintain consistency across devices, I implemented @media queries, making the layout responsive 
                            for different screen sizes. These styling choices ensure that the webpage remains both visually engaging 
                            and user-friendly.
                        </p> 

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>While developing this webpage, I took several measures to ensure it is accessible to all users, 
                           including those with disabilities. First, I specified lang="en" in the  &lt;html&gt; tag, enabling screen readers 
                           to correctly interpret the language of the content. 
                           I structured the page using appropriate heading tags ( &lt;h1&gt;,  &lt;h2&gt;, and  &lt;h3&gt;) to maintain a logical flow, 
                           making it easier for assistive technologies to navigate. Navigation links were placed in a  &lt;nav&gt; section 
                           to ensure easy access to different parts of the webpage.<br>
                           Additionally, I provided alt attributes for all images, allowing visually impaired users to understand the 
                           visual content through screen readers.
                           I also considered color contrast to improve readability for users with visual impairments. 
                           The text colors were carefully chosen to stand out against the background, ensuring clarity. 
                           The buttons and links were styled with clear hover effects using transition, making them easily distinguishable. 
                           I also ensured that interactive elements, such as buttons and links, could be accessed using the keyboard. 
                           Furthermore, I implemented responsive design with @media queries so that users on different devices, 
                           including those using screen magnifiers, could view the content comfortably. 
                           These accessibility features help create an inclusive and user-friendly experience for all visitors.

            <section>
                <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                    <p>During the implementation of this project, one of the main challenges we faced was coordinating work among team members. 
                       Since this was a group project, different individuals had different ideas about design choices, coding practices, and 
                       overall structure. At times, disagreements arose regarding the layout and styling elements, leading to inconsistencies 
                       in the code. Additionally, merging different sections of the project proved to be difficult, as conflicting changes 
                       in HTML and CSS files caused errors and formatting issues. To resolve these conflicts, we improved our communication and 
                       established a clear workflow. We decided to divide tasks more effectively and regularly update each other through meetings. 
                       Using version control Git, also helped us track changes and prevent accidental overwrites of code.<br>
                       Another major challenge was ensuring responsiveness and accessibility while maintaining a visually appealing 
                       design. Some team members initially focused more on aesthetics, while others prioritized functionality, causing a 
                       disconnect in the final product. To address this, we conducted testing on different screen sizes and devices, adjusting 
                       CSS properties like flexbox and media queries accordingly. We also had discussions to balance design and accessibility 
                       needs, making sure the website was both visually engaging and user friendly.</p> 
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 id="compliance"> Compliance</h2>
                    <p>During the development of our web pages, we primarily focused on creating a visually engaging and informative website rather 
                       than strictly adhering to specific regulations such as Janet regulations. However, many of the best practices we followed 
                       align with key aspects of responsible web development. For instance, we ensured that our content was appropriate for public 
                       access, avoided any copyrighted material by using properly sourced images, and maintained a structure that promotes clarity 
                       and accessibility.<br>
                       That being said, we recognize that compliance with Janet regulations involves more than just these considerations. 
                       Going forward, we would need to pay closer attention to aspects like data protection, user privacy, and security, 
                       ensuring that any forms or interactive elements comply with ethical guidelines. If we were to expand this project, 
                       we would conduct further research into Janetâ€™s specific requirements, particularly regarding accessibility, responsible 
                       content management, and online safety. This experience has highlighted the importance of understanding web regulations 
                       to create responsible and legally compliant digital content.
