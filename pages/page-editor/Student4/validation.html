                <p>
                    On the profile page, I made sure the data entered by users was correct and that the system handled
                    mistakes gracefully. I checked the name, email, and phone number fields to see if they were
                    formatted correctly, using built-in web features (like required, pattern, and type) to help users
                    avoid errors. I also checked that the calendar looked and worked properly on different devices,
                    making it accessible and easy to use for everyone.

                <p>For the Site Map Page, I checked the structure of my SVG design, ensuring all links were functional
                    and correctly mapped to their respective pages. I validated the SVG syntax to confirm compliance
                    with web standards, ensuring the visual elements rendered properly across browsers. This step was
                    crucial in maintaining a clear and organized site structure.

                <p>I checked the 'Sustainable Fishing' webpage to make sure it was well-designed and easy to use.
                    Specifically, I:
                <ul>
                    <li>Made sure the text was easy to read.</li>
                    <li>Confirmed the images adjusted properly to different screen sizes (e.g., mobile phones).</li>
                    <li>Used the correct HTML code to structure the content in a meaningful way (for example, using
                        heading
                        tags correctly).</li>
                    <li>Added descriptions (alt text) to all images so people using screen readers could understand
                        them.</li>
                    <li>Tested all the links on the page to make sure they worked and went to the right places.</li>
                </ul>
