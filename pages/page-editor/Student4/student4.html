                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                <p>
                    I have designed the profile page to showcase personal details, skills, goals, and volunteering
                    availability
                    while aligning with the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) theme: Life Below Water. The HTML
                    structure is well-organized with semantic elements like
                    &lt;section&gt;, &lt;div&gt;, and &lt;h1&gt; to improve readability and maintainability. Each
                    section focuses on distinct content:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Profile Section:</strong> Displays user information, including name, bio, and a profile
                    image. The
                    btn-contact link allows users to connect directly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>About Section:</strong> Lists personal details and skills, utilizing progress bars to
                    visually represent
                    skill levels.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Goals Section:</strong> Utilizes cards to present goals, frustrations, and experiences with
                    clear labels and
                    images.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Calendar Section: </strong> Features a dynamic calendar integrated via JavaScript for users
                    to select dates
                    and view event details.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>UN Goals Section:</strong> Displays SDG-related images with descriptive alt text for
                    improved context.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Contact Form Section:</strong> Includes labeled input fields with required attributes to
                    ensure users provide
                    essential information before submitting.
                </p>

                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>
                    This profile page is designed to be usable by people with disabilities by following these key
                    principles:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Easy Navigation for Screen Readers:</strong> The page uses correct HTML heading tags (like
                    &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, etc.) to organize content, making it easy for screen readers to understand
                    the structure and
                    jump to different sections.

                <p>
                    <strong>Image Descriptions:</strong> Every image has a text description (using the "alt" attribute)
                    that explains
                    what the image is, helping people who can't see the image understand its meaning.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Mouse-Free Navigation:</strong> The calendar controls (previous/next buttons) can be used
                    using only the
                    keyboard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Clear Form Fields:</strong> Form labels are correctly linked to their input fields, which
                    helps assistive
                    technology users understand what information is required in each field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Readable Colors:</strong> The colors used for text and progress bars have enough contrast
                    against the
                    background, making them easier to read for everyone, including people with low vision.
                    Visible Focus: When you navigate the page with the keyboard, the currently selected link or
                    button has a clear visual highlight, so you know where you are.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With these practices, the profile page effectively balances design aesthetics with functionality and
                    accessibility, ensuring a positive user experience for all visitors.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2 id="sitemap">Sitemap Page</h2>
                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                <p>
                    The sitemap page is designed using SVG elements to create an interactive visual representation of
                    the website's structure. The SVG integrates clickable nodes wrapped in &lt;a&gt; tags, which link to
                    key sections such as profile, volunteer opportunities, reviews, statistics and feedback form. Each
                    clickable node is defined
                    using &lt;rect&gt; elements styled with specific dimensions, rounded corners (rx), and color fills
                    to
                    distinguish different sections. The nodes also include associated &lt;text&gt; tags for clear
                    labeling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To improve maintainability and flexibility, &lt;path&gt; elements previously used for text
                    have been replaced with &lt;text&gt; tags, allowing better control over styling through
                    CSS. The overall layout is structured to ensure clarity and visual hierarchy,
                    with connecting lines created using SVG <path> elements to represent
                        relationships between different sections.
                </p>

                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>Accessibility enhancements have been incorporated to ensure the sitemap is navigable and
                    user-friendly for all users, including those relying on assistive technologies. Each clickable
                    &lt;a&gt;
                    tag now includes tabindex="0" to support keyboard navigation and role="link" to improve screen
                    reader compatibility. Additionally, &lt;title&gt; tags have been added within each link to provide
                    meaningful descriptions for screen readers.

                    By replacing text-rendered &lt;path&gt; elements with proper &lt;text&gt; tags, the content is now
                    more accessible, ensuring users can easily interpret the sitemap's structure. These
                    improvements enhance usability for keyboard-only users and those using screen
                    readers, aligning with best practices in web accessibility.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2 id="content">Content Page</h2>
                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                <p>
                    The content page is structured using HTML5 with semantic tags for improved organization and
                    readability. The &lt;section&gt; elements are effectively utilized to group content into meaningful
                    parts, such as "What is Overfishing?" and "The Human Cost of Overfishing." Each section is
                    accompanied by descriptive headings (&lt;h1&gt; and &lt;h2&gt;) and paragraphs that provide
                    informative content. External CSS stylesheets are linked for design consistency, with one stylesheet
                    dedicated to content-specific styling and another for global styling. Navigation is enhanced by a
                    sidebar containing anchor links (&lt;a href="#sectionX"&gt;) that allow users to jump to relevant
                    content sections. Images are organized in containers with appropriate &lt;img&gt; tags to support
                    visual storytelling.
                </p>

                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>
                    The page incorporates various accessibility features to enhance usability. The lang="en" attribute
                    is included in the &lt;html&gt; tag to define the language, supporting screen readers. Images are
                    accompanied by meaningful alt text that describes their content, ensuring visually impaired users
                    can understand the visual elements. Clear and informative headings are used throughout the content
                    to improve readability and support keyboard navigation. The sidebar navigation enables quick access
                    to key sections, improving the user experience for those using assistive technologies. While the
                    content is generally accessible, adding features like ARIA landmarks for better screen reader
                    navigation and ensuring color contrast meets accessibility standards would further enhance
                    inclusivity.

            <section>
                <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>One of the main challenges I faced was a lack of team collaboration. While one or two members worked
                    diligently, others took a more passive approach, waiting until the last minute to contribute. This
                    lack of shared responsibility made it difficult to maintain consistent progress throughout the
                    project.
                </p>

                <p>
                    whenever a team member presented an idea, it was often disregarded without considering its potential
                    value, which led to a lack of constructive discussion and idea development.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, these challenges taught me valuable lessons about teamwork and project management. I
                    learned the importance of clear communication, setting expectations early on, and ensuring that all
                    team members are equally invested in the project.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Additionally, I gained a better understanding of my strengths and weaknesses as a collaborator,
                    allowing me to reflect on how I can improve my contributions in future group projects. Despite these
                    challenges, I am grateful for the opportunity to grow and develop these important skills.
