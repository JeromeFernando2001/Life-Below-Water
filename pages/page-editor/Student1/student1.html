                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>I have created this splash screen using HTML and CSS to make it visually appealing and fully responsive. 
                            I used a "&lt;div class="splash-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; to cover the entire screen and added a background image with 
                            background-size: cover; so it scales properly. To make the text readable over the image, I added an overlay using
                            .splash-container::before, which gives a semi-transparent blue effect. Inside this container, 
                            I placed another "&lt;div class="content"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; to hold the logos, heading, description, and team names.
                            The logos are styled with brightness and a glow effect using filter: brightness(2) contrast(1.2); 
                            and box-shadow, making them stand out.<br>
                            For the text, I used &lt;h1&gt; for the title and &lt;h2&gt; for the team section, ensuring a clear structure. 
                            I also added text-shadow to improve readability against the background.
                            The description and team names are styled with color: white; and opacity: 0.9; to create a clean 
                            and soft look. To make the page more interactive, I added a fade in animation using @keyframes fadeIn, 
                            making the content appear smoothly.<br>
                            Since the page needs to work well on different screen sizes, I used media queries. 
                            On tablets and smaller screens, I reduced font sizes, adjusted padding, and made the logos smaller to keep everything balanced. 
                            Overall, I focused on design, functionality, and responsiveness to ensure the page looks good and is easy to read on any device.
                        </p> 
                    
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>I made sure to address accessibility in this splash screen by following key principles that improve readability, usability,
                           and inclusivity. First, I used semantic HTML elements such as &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;h2&gt; for headings and &lt;p&gt; for descriptions. 
                           This helps screen readers and improves the pageâ€™s structure for users who rely on assistive technologies.<br>
                           To ensure text readability, I used high color contrast by setting color: white; for the text and applying a semi transparent overlay
                           (.splash-container::before) to darken the background. This prevents text from blending into the image, making it easier to read. 
                           I also added text shadow to further enhance visibility.<br>
                           For responsive design, I used media queries to adjust text size, layout, and padding for different screen sizes. 
                           This helps users who access the page from mobile devices or tablets. 
                           Additionally, images such as the logos include an alt attribute, so screen readers can describe them to visually impaired users.<br>
                           The fade-in animation is subtle and does not flash or move too fast, reducing the risk of motion triggered discomfort for users with visual sensitivity. 
                           By following these accessibility practices, I made sure the page is inclusive, easy to navigate, and visually clear for all users.
