                        Coral reefs are among the most diverse and valuable ecosystems on Earth. They provide shelter to marine life,
                        protect coastlines, and support millions of people. However, human activities are pushing them to the brink of extinction.

                        <p>
                            Coral reefs are underwater ecosystems built by colonies of tiny marine animals called coral polyps. These reefs
                            are primarily composed of calcium carbonate structures and serve as habitats for countless marine species.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Found in warm, shallow waters, coral reefs support biodiversity, protect shorelines from erosion, and contribute
                            to the economy through tourism and fisheries.

                            Coral reefs are under threat from human activities such as overfishing, pollution, and climate change. Rising
                            sea temperatures cause coral bleaching, where corals lose their vibrant colors and become more vulnerable to disease.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Other threats include coastal development, destructive fishing methods, and plastic pollution, which damage
                            coral reef ecosystems.

                            Coral reefs support over 25% of all marine life, providing food, shelter, and breeding grounds for numerous species.
                            They also act as natural barriers, protecting coastal communities from storms and erosion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Additionally, coral reefs contribute to medical research, with many species being studied for potential treatments
                            for diseases like cancer and Alzheimerâ€™s.

                            Protecting coral reefs requires global and local efforts. Governments can establish Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)
                            to prevent destructive human activities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Individuals can help by reducing plastic waste, using reef-safe sunscreens, supporting sustainable seafood,
                            and participating in coral restoration projects.
